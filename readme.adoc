Purpose of this sample project is to make students familiar with basic technologies they're going to use during the Software Engineering Lab at Technical University of Dresden.

== Quickstart

=== Using GitPod

http://gitpod.io/[GitPod] is a cloud IDE that allows you to work with a project right from your browser:

1. Click https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/guestbook[this link] to open the project in GitPod.
2. Wait for the build to finish (see progress in the console view).
3. Once the website opens in the embedded preview browser, the project is ready to be worked with.

=== Local machine

NOTE: Working on your local machine requires Java 11, and a recent Git (2.21 or better preferred) to be available on your machine.
If you miss any of those go through the steps described in <<prerequisites>>.
Also, note that you have to run `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw` if you run Windows by accident.

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/guestbook
$ cd guestbook
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

After that point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
Note that Spring Boot creates a default user `user` with a random password printed to the console when the application starts, as described in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-security[Spring Boot reference docs].

== Prerequisites

=== Java 11

https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot[Download] the binaries, install. Make sure the console shows something like this:

[source, bash]
----
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.12+7 (build 11.0.12+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.12+7 (build 11.0.12+7, mixed mode)
----

Make sure that the wrapped Maven picks up the same JDK version and that the following command shows similar output:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./mvnw --version
Apache Maven 3.8.3 (ff8e977a158738155dc465c6a97ffaf31982d739)
Maven home: /Users/JavaJoe/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-3.8.3-bin/5a6n1u8or3307vo2u2jgmkhm0t/apache-maven-3.8.3
Java version: 11.0.12, vendor: Eclipse Adoptium, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-11.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: de_DE, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "11.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
----

=== Git

https://git-scm.com/download[Download] the binaries, run the installer. Verify the command line shows something like this after install:

[source, bash]
----
$ git --version
git version 2.33.0
----

== IDE Setup

=== Eclipse

Grab the latest https://spring.io/tools[Spring Tool Suite] (plain Eclipse should work as well), run installer or unzip and run it.

Select menu:File[Import], select menu:Maven[Existing Maven Projects], select the folder you checked the project out into and hit btn:[Finish]. This will import the project into your workspace.

In the Console view you might wanna click the btn:[Open Console] button and select Maven Console to see that Maven is downloading dependencies, sources and Javadocs.

=== IntelliJ

Grab the latest https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA IDE] (both Community Edition and Ultimate Edition will work), install it according to the instructions on their website and run it.

From the Welcome Screen, select btn:[Import Project]. Otherwise, if you've already opened another project, you'll need to select menu:File[New > Project from existing sources].
Now, navigate to the folder you checked the project out into, select the `pom.xml` file and hit btn:[Open].

In the opened wizard, additionally select the checkboxes btn:[Import Maven projects automatically], as well as the btn:[Sources] and btn:[Documentation] checkboxes next to btn:[Automically download] and hit btn:[Next].
On the next page, do not select any profile and hit btn:[Next]. Now, ensure the Maven project is selected for import and hit btn:[Next].
On the following page, ensure you've selected a version 11 or higher JDK and hit btn:[Next].
On the final page, leave the suggested project name as is and hit btn:[Finish].

Now you have to wait a bit while IntelliJ and Maven work on importing the project, which includes downloading all required dependencies from the internet.
All IDE activities are displayed in the status bar.
